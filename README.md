Here you can find an example of a browser game programmed with Lua, which can be generated and hosted on the AXC F 2152.

## Introduction
To create the game, love.js is used, which is LÖVE ported to the web using Emscripten. More information about this open source framework for 2D game development can be found here: [LÖVE - Free 2D Game Engine (love2d.org)](https://love2d.org/)
